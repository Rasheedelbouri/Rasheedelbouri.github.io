				<p>My research focuses on reinforcement and meta-learning for the improvement of the efficiencies with which healthcare is
delivered. Healthcare datasets are often incomplete and difficult to access meaning the transfer of acquired knowledge is key
to data-efficient learning. To date I have worked with differential model-based and model-free RL, automated curriuclum
generation, multi-armed bandit methods and generative models to tackle these issues. Future work will look into expanding
upon current research as well as investigating the relationship between curriculum, transfer and continual learning.</a></p>
